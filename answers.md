### **1. Components of a DBMS**

1. **Database Engine**: Handles data storage, retrieval, and updates.
2. **Database Schema**: Defines the structure of the database.
3. **Query Processor**: Interprets and executes SQL queries.
4. **Transaction Management**: Ensures ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
5. **Storage Manager**: Manages physical data storage.
6. **Security Manager**: Manages user access and data protection.
7. **Backup and Recovery Manager**: Handles data backups and recovery.
8. **Data Dictionary**: Stores metadata about the database structure.

### **2. What is a Relational Database? Give 4 Examples.**

A **relational database** stores data in tables with rows and columns, using relationships between tables.

**Examples**:
1. MySQL
2. PostgreSQL
3. Microsoft SQL Server
4. Oracle Database

### **3. Three Classifications of SQL**

1. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Manages data (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
2. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Defines database structure (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`).
3. **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Manages permissions (e.g., `GRANT`, `REVOKE`).

### **4. Difference Between Primary Key and Foreign Key**

- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: Links one table to another, referencing the primary key of another table.

### **5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?**

An **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** is a visual representation of entities and their relationships in a database.

### **6. Advantages of Relational Databases**

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensures consistency and accuracy.
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to modify and scale.
3. **ACID Compliance**: Guarantees reliable transactions.
4. **Security**: Provides access control mechanisms.

---

### **7. Four Types of Data Types Used to Store Data in Tables**

1. **INT**: Stores integer values.
2. **VARCHAR**: Stores variable-length strings.
3. **DATE**: Stores date values.
4. **DECIMAL**: Stores precise numeric values with decimals.

---

### **8. Purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS)**

A **DBMS** manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, ensuring data security, integrity, and backup, while supporting multi-user concurrency.
